# **portfolio assignment**

One of the few things I was challenged while making this assignment was trying to learn more about bootstrap and time management. Even though I learned the basics of Bootstrap, there were some parts where I needed to think and implement the content carefully. Whenever I got stuck, I looked at the internet on how to do what I couldn't do in the first place. As for my time management, I had to stay up late to make up with the due date. The most Important lesson I've learned from this web portfolio is to start early in a proper way so that you are not in a frustrating situation which puts you in a tricky spot.
